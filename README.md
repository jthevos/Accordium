# Accordium

This is a composer's aid where touching colors on an iPad will produce chords.

Colors available come from a 12 tone color wheel that is split into
    1. Shades
    2. Tints
    3. Hues
    4. Tones

This instrument assumes 12-tone equal temperament as its musical base.

Timbre chosen is arbitrary; however, a FM Synthesized timbre using a 3:1 ratio
between and carrier and modulator was the aesthetic choice.

Requirements:
    1. JythonMusic
    2. An iPad or iPhone with TouchOSC installed

Messages are sent from the iPad to the computer using the Open Sound Control
protocol.
